# SimonSays-Game
This project is based on HTML,CSS and Javascript.
It uses DOM manipulation techniques such as add.EventListeners() to make the game responsive to users.
*WORKING* : In this game, the user needs to press anykey from the keyboard to start the game. Once the game starts, any button on random will flash on the screen. The user needs to click on the flashed button, on doing this the game levels up and again another button will flash on random , this time the user needs remember the previous sequence and then press the new flashed button.
On clicking the wrong sequence, the game resets and shows the final result.
